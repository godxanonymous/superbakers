          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">

          <h3 className="font-fredoka text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Receiving Your Order</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            Because our products are perishable and delicate, someone must be present at the delivery address to receive the order during the scheduled time slot. If no one is available, the driver will attempt to contact you. After 15 minutes of waiting, the order will be returned to the branch for pickup, and the delivery fee will not be refunded.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-fredoka text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Handling & Care</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            Once the cake is handed over, the responsibility for its condition passes to the customer. Please ensure it is transported on a flat surface (like a car floorboard, not a slanted car seat) and kept in a cool environment away from direct sunlight.
