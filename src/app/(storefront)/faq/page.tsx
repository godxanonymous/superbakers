const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I order a custom cake?",
    answer: "For custom cakes, we recommend placing your order at least 48 to 72 hours in advance. For elaborate wedding cakes or large corporate events, please contact us 2-3 weeks prior to ensure availability."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer vegan or gluten-free options?",
    answer: "Currently, our primary menu features traditional baking methods using premium dairy and wheat. However, we do occasionally offer special dietary options. Please contact our Wah Cantt branch directly to discuss specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your delivery radius?",
    answer: "We deliver within a 15km radius of our Wah Cantt and Rawalpindi branches. Delivery charges are calculated at checkout based on your exact location. Free delivery is available for orders over Rs. 3000."
  },
  {
    question: "How should I store my cake?",
    answer: "Most of our cakes should be refrigerated if not consumed immediately. However, for the best taste and texture, we recommend taking the cake out of the fridge 30-45 minutes before serving so it can come to room temperature."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my order after it's been placed?",
    answer: "Modifications to standard orders can be made up to 24 hours before the scheduled delivery/pickup time. Custom cake orders cannot be modified within 48 hours of the scheduled time as preparation has already begun."
